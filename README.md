# Leave Management System

A college project built with Django REST Framework (backend) and React + TypeScript (frontend).

## Features

- Three roles: Admin, Manager, Employee
- JWT-based authentication with token blacklisting on logout
- Leave CRUD with overlap and balance validation
- Approval workflow: Employee applies → Manager approves/rejects → Admin oversees
- Role-based dashboard with live stats
- Filters, search, sort, pagination on leave list
- In-app notifications with unread count badge
- Swagger API docs at `/api/docs/`

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | Django 4.2, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL |
| Auth | SimpleJWT (access + refresh tokens, token blacklist) |
| Docs | drf-spectacular (Swagger / ReDoc) |
| Frontend | React 18, TypeScript, Vite |
| State | Redux Toolkit + RTK Query |
| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod |
| Styles | Tailwind CSS |
| Notifications | Toast (react-hot-toast) |

## Architecture

```
backend/
  config/          -- Django settings, root URLs
  apps/
    users/         -- Custom User model, auth views, RBAC permissions
    leaves/        -- LeaveType, LeaveBalance, LeaveRequest + approval logic
    notifications/ -- In-app notification model and views

frontend/
  src/
    store/         -- Redux store + authSlice
    api/           -- RTK Query slices (auth, leave, notification)
    components/    -- Reusable UI components
    pages/         -- Route-level page components
    types/         -- Shared TypeScript interfaces
    hooks/         -- useAuth custom hook
```

Each app follows a **repository → service → view** pattern:
- Repository: all ORM queries
- Service: all business rules (overlap check, balance check, approval flow)
- View: validates HTTP input, calls service, returns response
